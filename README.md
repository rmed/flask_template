# Flask application template 

This repository contains a Flask template and other *recipes* I tend to replicate in most projects. Each *recipe* is intended to be added to the code in the `base` directory, indicating the file in which the coud should be added.

The directory layout is as follows:

- `base`: This directory contains the basic application structure and configuration 
- `async_loading`: Recipe for loading content of HTML tags asynchronously through AJAX
- `celery`: Recipe for asynchronous tasks using Celery and Redis
- `socketio`: Recipe adding websocket support through Flask-SocketIO
